# GW-AEE
Solar District Cup
As a dedicated member of the GW AEE (Association of Energy Engineers) design team, I played an instrumental role in the Solar District Cup, where we achieved a compelling 9.04% Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for our solar district system. This achievement underscored the project's financial viability and long-term sustainability, highlighting our commitment to creating economically feasible renewable energy solutions.

My responsibilities included orchestrating the design and integration of mechanical components within the solar-powered district energy system. I ensured that all mechanical elements functioned seamlessly and efficiently, achieving an overall system efficiency of 98%. This meticulous attention to detail was critical for the successful implementation and operation of the system.

Furthermore, I engineered a solar district system that demonstrated exceptional performance, yielding an impressive annual energy output of 9.4 gigawatt-hours (GWh). This substantial energy production not only showcased the system's capability but also its potential impact on reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices.

Overall, my role in the GW AEE design team allowed me to apply my engineering skills to real-world renewable energy projects, contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy systems and demonstrating the viability of solar district solutions.
